# PDB - MHD Route Finder Project

## Overview

This is project developed for the PDB course (Advanced Database Systems) at BUT FIT. Goal of this project is to design
an application that leverages both relational and NoSQL databases and implement REST API using both of these.

For our application we designed **Route Finder** application. It is a search tool for planning routes from one location
to another. It provides users with the closest upcoming routes available via buses, trains, and trams, along with
real-time vehicle information such as:

- Current position
- Estimated delay
- Occupancy levels

REST API is implemented in .NET and integrates **MsSQL** for the relational database and **MongoDB** for NoSQL storage.
